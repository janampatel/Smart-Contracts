Using solidity language we can directly deploy our smart contracts on etherium blockchain.
I have uploaded solidity codes which explains all basics concepts of Solidity language.
I have also implemended Decentralised Lottery System and Decentralised Election System using basic concepts of solidity language.
Decentralised systems are transparent enough as: No human intervention, data is publicaly available on blockchain, data can not be tampered or deleted.
